Recently I have been looking at source codes of some good open source libraries and every time I be like, Wow.. how didn't I think about something like this yet.

Today we are going to talk about [jotai](https://jotai.org), an atomic state management solution for React JS. The creator of jotai [Daishi Kato](https://github.com/dai-shi), recently shared a [tweet](https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1484835169475653634?s=20) about simplified version of jotai. This article will be around that tweet. It was quite interesting how simple thing can make huge impact on React Ecosystem.

Let's understand this.

```javascript
// This is how we create atoms in react codebase using jotai
import  { atom }  from  'jotai'

const messageAtom =  atom('hello')
const countAtom = atom(1)
```
   
State in jotai is just a collection of atoms. Atoms are not tied with any specific component, that means you can export this *messageAtom* and import it any other module. This is how it is implemented.

```javascript
export const atom = (initialValue) => ({ init: initialValue });
```
It's a function that returns a config object. This object holds the initial value of that atom.

<br/>

Okay, we might have many atoms like this in our codebase, right ? So now we need some map kind of thing to hold them all. Here comes the atomStateMap.

```javascript
const atomStateMap = new WeakMap();
```

Why WeakMap though ? It helps in garbage collection. Key in WeakMap can only be an object and it doesn't prevent garbage collection of key objects.

  ```javascript
let john = { name: "John" };
let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(john, "...");
john = null; // overwrite the reference

// john is removed from memory!
weakmap.get(john) // undefined
```

If reference of john doesn't exist, the key is removed from weakmap and free it's value if not referenced anywhere else.

Get and Set atoms in atomStateMap.
```javascript
const getAtomState = (atom) => {
	let atomState = atomStateMap.get(atom);
	if(!atomState) {
		atomState = { value: atom.init, listeners: new Set() };
		atomStateMap.set(atom, atomState);
	}
	return atomState;
}
```
*getAtomState* returns the atom's state from *atomStateMap*.  If there is no entry of that atom, it registers that atom in *atomStateMap*.
*atomState* contains current value of that atom and a set of listeners. Listeners are simply a set of callback functions for specific components. 
<br/>

<CodeSandbox codeSandboxId="jotai-example-7wzri" />

Let's say in [this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/jotai-example-7wzri), *IncrementCounter* and *DecrementCounter* are using the same atom. So if value of *countAtom* is changed in a component then we need to notify other component about that state change and trigger re-rendering for both component. 

Now how we are going to use this atom in our functional component ? For that we will need a custom hook called *useAtom*.

```javascript
export const useAtom = (atom) => {
	const atomState = getAtomState(atom);
	const [value, setValue] = useState(atomState.value);
	
	useEffect(() => {
		const callback = () => setValue(atomState.value);
		atomState.listeners.add(callback);
		callback();
		return () => atomState.listeners.delete(callback);
	}, [atomState]);
	
	const setAtom = (nextValue) => {
		atomState.value = nextValue;
		atomState.listeners.forEach((l) => l());
	};
	return [value, setAtom];
};
```
First we fetch the latest state of that atom via calling *getAtomState* function. We need to trigger re-rendering if atom's value changes, right ? so what's better than using a useState hook.

Now we need to register our subscription for atom's value change. We create a callback function and push it in listeners array. We should unsubscribe that subscription if component is unmounted.

*setAtom* provides us functionality to update atom's value. Here we calling each callback in our listeners array. So it will trigger re-rendering for each of that component.

What happens if components that are using this atom are in different routes ? Since atom is not attached with any component, *getAtomState* will fetch the latest atom's state (that might have updated in some other pages) and register a subscription for that atom.

A simple example of useAtom hooks
```javascript
const countAtom = atom(0);

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  const inc = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return (
    <div>
      {count} <button onClick={inc}>+1</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```


## Ending Notes

That's all. Now you understand the magic behind jotai's state management, on a simplified level of course. This might help you in contributing jotai's open-source repository or just for understanding how global statement management work under the hood.
